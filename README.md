Youtube audio only
=============

[Firefox addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-audio_only/)

This is based on [Youtube Audio](https://github.com/animeshkundu/youtube-audio). Feel free to pick which version you like.

Extension for turning off video on youtube.

I mostly listen to songs a lot on youtube while working. The video playing in the background just heats up my laptop, eats up my battery and data / bandwidth. Youtube doesn't provide this functionality natively.

Disable video for youtube songs which saves battery life and bandwidth / data.

I don't have a safari or chrome developer account. Anyone willing to help, please PM me. :)
