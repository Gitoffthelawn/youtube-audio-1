Youtube audio only
=============

[Firefox addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-audio_only/)  
[Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/aommfmmbfgomgfndghgedemfdeidldbb/)  

Rewrite is based on [Youtube Audio](https://github.com/animeshkundu/youtube-audio) and [Audio Only Youtube](https://github.com/Ashish-Bansal/audio-only-youtube). Feel free to pick which version you like.

Extension for turning off video on youtube.

I mostly listen to songs a lot on youtube while working. The video playing in the background just heats up my laptop, eats up my battery and data / bandwidth. Youtube doesn't provide this functionality natively.

Disable video for youtube songs which saves battery life and bandwidth / cpu.

Note: Youtube live videos is not supported.
